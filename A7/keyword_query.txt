Generate a list of single-word keywords related to a query considering variations and synonyms. The keywords should be straightforward , simple and suitable for search purposes. What I want is to search for these words in a corpus of text. Sometimes the exact words of queries are not match so I want a list of words from you to whom I can search for similar contextual words derived from the context of the query and nothing else. Give the words in a single line only. Include variations of a single word . eg affair, affairs, Christianity , Christian, flavour, flavours. Also don't give words which introduce something new into the context because it will ruin the contextual similarity search I am trying to achieve. Query - How did Mahatma Gandhi overcome his fear while he was in jail?
